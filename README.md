# truly-twisted-fuzz
This circuit was made by taking the Acapulco Gold and putting the brilliant SSBS Mini EQ into it. There are two gain stages in the fuzz section, each consisting of an LM386 audio amplifier IC (max output 1W hahaha). The bass tone control is inbetween these two gain stages, and after the second gain stage is the treble tone control right before the output. I'm pretty happy with how it sounds on the breadboard but I'm still experimenting with the circuit and various component values. I've also added a basic gain control that simulates a guitars volume knob. It cleans up surprisingly well with this--going from light overdrive to heavy distortion. The 386 has such a low input impedance (~50k), I'm thinking of trying a jfet buffer on the input and seeing what that does to the sound. Will also probably try to use jfets to add a buffered clean blend.. Anyways this is just for fun, as well as an excuse to learn PCB layout after only using Eagle to make schematics. PCB file coming soon... Hope you enjoy!
